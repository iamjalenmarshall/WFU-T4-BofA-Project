Basic Beginners Guide to git:

First, to get the repo on your computer use command:

git clone <url> ---- The url can be found under the green code button on the repo m ain page


Second, it's good practice to check what branch you are on and the status of what files are tracked vs untracked

The command " git branch " will tell you which branch you're on which will be useful as the project progresses

" git status " Should be useful right away once we start working on files on our devices

Third, 

" git pull " ---- git pull will update all the changes made to the repo and bring them onto your local device 


Now here are the main commands to submit to the repo:

1. git add file.py  OR git add . ; git add prepares files to be uploaded to the repo. You can either decalre a file based off its full

name or you can use a period to add all files.

2. git commit -m "message" ; git commit is the step right before the final send off where you bundle up all your git add's and then give

a concise message about what all your commit has "updated isolation forest model" and so on.

3. To submit all the files you've worked on after using git add and git commit you'll use the " git push " command to send your files to

the repo. 

I'll have to explain the push and pull a bit more, but that can come later as we get deeper into the project. If you have any questions
